Big Stuff
---------

* Interact cells

* Code completion

* Single-cell mode

  - Create hash tag routes (...#cell15, etc) so that someone can reference a single cell in a presentation with a url

  - Hash tag routes should probably reference cell id's not their order. That way when the worksheet is changed all of the links still work as expected

* Add option to store the notebook in a database instead of filesystem.

  - figure out which database systems to support

  - check out sagenb/storage/abstract_storage.py

* Testing, testing, testing

* Use three.js or something else instead of Jmol

  - See https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/sage-notebook/97AGs2hN3po

* Use sockets.io instead of async_request

  - use TornadIO2 https://github.com/MrJoes/tornadio2

Medium Stuff
------------

* Login page

* Report a problem dialog

* Help page

  - Choose between a popup window or a docked thing on the page or both.

* Log dialog/page

* Evaluate all cells

  - We cannot just run through every cell and call cell.evaluate(). Each cell has to be evaluated one at time. This means creating some sort of queue.

* Add grab image button to Jmol

  - I don't think this is high priority (unless someone really needs it). Hopefully, we'll get rid of Jmol soon anyways

* Create automatic print-friendly option

* Fix unfixable Jmol z-index bug

  - Try opening some Jmol plot and then scrolling down so that the Jmol appears over the navbar.

  - I've tried *almost* every iframe over applet trick out there but I think the most promising (and so far untried hack) would be to create an iframe inside the iframe which Jmol is in. Give the iframe in the iframe full width and the height of the navbar. Then, set the position of the iframe in the iframe to be the same as the position of the navbar (ie. when the iframe is below the navbar the iframe in the iframe would have a negative y value, because the y vale or css top property is relative to its parent iframe). Dynamically update the position of the iframe in the iframe when the user scrolls. It would be a horrible hack and it may just be easier to get rid of Jmol.

Small Stuff
-----------

* Logout
* Restart sage
* Make checking for output occur on an exponential timer not every X seconds

  - See cell.check_for_output() in worksheet.js

* Interrupt

  - See worksheet.interrupt() and cell.check_for_output() in worksheet.js

* Clean up LESS

  - see sagenb/data/sage/less/

* Clean up javascript

  - see sagenb/data/sage/js/

  - maybe use prototypes

  - maybe separate the different cell types.. this sounds easy but I'm not sure what kind of nasty issues there might be yet

  - checkout some of IPython's code

* Clean up base.py and worksheet.py in flask_version/

Frontend
========

The frontend of the Sage Notebook is built on Twitter's Bootstrap framework, MathJax, LESS, TinyMCE, and CodeMirror. Content is loaded dynamically -- no more sending HTML back-and-forth between the server and the browser. All communication is done with JSON using the encode_response and decode_response functions.

CSS vs LESS vs SASS/SCSS
------------------------

CSS preprocessing is very similar to CSS and significantly speeds up development. The choice between LESS and SASS is tough. The Notebook is written in LESS for the time being primarily because the Bootstrap framework is built on LESS. I would certainly not be offended, however, if someone was interested in rewriting the stylesheet in SASS.
